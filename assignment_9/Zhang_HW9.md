1. A brief summary of the how you chose to generate your forecast this week.
   
   I built an autoregressive linear model with predictors of flows during one- and two-week ago. The coefficient of determination is 0.33. The forecast for this week is 224.2 cfs.

2. A description of the dataset you added
* What is the dataset? Why did you choose it?
  
  I used daymet precipitation dataset because daymet has a resolution of 4 km and can reflect the average precipitation input condition near the USGS gage. Contrastly, in-situ observed precipitation only reflects water input into this site; however, streamflow is not just that water runs off the land surface but also gather together due to topography.

* What location have you chosen?
  
  I picked a grid cell with latitude of 34.448 and longitude of -111.789 (that is  the river basin where our site is located).

* Where did you get the data from? What was your approach to accessing it?
  
  I used url method to get the data from daymet api.


3. A plot of your additional time series along with your streamflow time series.
