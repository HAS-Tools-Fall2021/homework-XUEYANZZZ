Following the instruction of HW1 on Github, I downloaded USGS daily streamflow
data for site 09506000 Verde River near camp Verde, AZ. I guessed the average daily streamflow for next week and two weeks later would be 200 cfs
and 150 cfs, respectively, because the monsoon season is approaching the end .
