Following the instruction of HW1 on Github, I downloaded USGS daily streamflow
data for site 09506000 Verde River near camp Verde, AZ. I guessed the average daily streamflow for next week and two weeks later would be 200 cfs
and 150 cfs, respectively, because the monsoon season is approaching the end .

## Grade
3/3 - great job!
One note though I looks like your csv in the forecast submission folder got re-named 'xuZhang copy.csv' next time don't make a copy of the file just edit it directly and make sure not to change the name.
